My first first showing my ability to create simple app using RoR/database/CSS/JQuery/AJAX technologies.

Use cases:
- user clicks on the grid and can create a spot that appears on the screen
- user can add a name for the spot (when no name supplied, the spot will have name with an ID number)
- spots can not interfere with each other
- user can move spots with drag-drop feature
- spots appear in the screen without page reload
